### Tracing php in userspace

In this lab, you will learn how to trace a php program and visualize the execution of a program in a flame graph.

*Pre-requisites*: Have Trace Compass installed and opened. You can follow the [Installing TraceCompass](00-installing-tracecompass.md) lab or read the [TraceCompass web site](https://tracecompass.org) for more information. Have Php 7.x and Lttng >= 2.8 installed.

#### Sub-task 1: Configure Lttng extension

You can build and install the LTTng extension from source which is straightforward:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/naser/LTTng-php-tracing-module.git
$ cd LTTng-php-tracing-module
$ phpize
# Before configuration, make sure you have LTTng 2.X installed in your machine. For installation manual refer to: http://lttng.org/docs/v2.9/#doc-installing-lttng
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

After installation you will need to add `extension=lttng.so` to your primary *php.ini* file. To do so, run php -m in the command line to check if lttng is among the installed php extensions. If it is not there, you should manually enable it. 

```bash
$ php --ini
```

Open the php.ini with an editor, search for 'Exentions' (or 'Dynamic Extensions') within the ini file and add this line there:
```
extension=lttng.so
```

Now run the php -m (or php -m | grep lttng) in the command line and this time you should see the lttng in the installed and enabled modules 
```bash
# To see if lttng extension is loaded
$ php -m | grep lttng
lttng
```

#### Sub-task 2: Record a php trace

There are two scripts called `trace-start` and `trace-stop` that make the process of recording a trace much easier. You can record a trace by running the `trace-start` script, running your php code and then running `trace-stop`:
```bash
$ lttng-record-trace -p php php script.php
```
The `trace-stop` should display the events recorded, here is a sample of what it should look like:
```

#### Sub-task 3: Install the Generic Callstack add-on

To visualize the call stack of an application in a flamegraph you need to install the *Generic Callstack (Incubation)* add-on from the *Tools > Add-ons* menu.

#### Sub-task 4: Import the trace into Trace Compass

After importing the trace (the [following tutorial](../01-trace-navigation-in-tracecompass.md) explains how to do that and how to navigate in the trace), you need to add an analysis XML file to enable php callstack analysis on TraceCompass.

![ManageXML](screenshots/manageXML.png "Manage XML")

After opening the *Manage XML analyses files* window you need to click on the `Import` button and search for the [final-php-callstack.xml](final-php-callstack.xml) file. After importing this file you can click on the `Apply and Close` button.

#### Sub-task 5: Opening the Flame Chart

Now that everything is setup you should be able to open the *Flame Chart* in the *Project Explorer View* in *Views > PHP Callstack View > Flame Chart (incubator)*. If you ran the script.php or opened the trace given in this lab, it should look like this:

![QuicksortTrace](screenshots/quicksortTrace.png "Quicksort Trace")

If you look at the code, there is actually 2 executions of the same `quicksort` function. The first execution is an average case scenario where the array elements are randomly sorted, and the second execution is a worst case scenario where the array element are sorted in reverse order.
In the trace it can easily be seen that the second execution is much faster and takes a lot less function calls. This view can be very useful to analyze what is actually happening when the program is running, and what functions gets called.

#### Conclusion

In the lab you learned how to trace a php program, and how to setup *Trace Compass* to visualize this PHP User space trace in a Flame Chart. You should now be able to use these tools to better understand the execution of an application, and visualize what units of code have to be refactored to obtain better performance.

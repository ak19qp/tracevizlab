## Trace Visualization Labs

This repository contains a series of labs and guides for collecting traces from the operating system or userspace applications or cloud environments, and visualizing them with trace visualization tools. While most of the labs will use [LTTng](http://lttng.org) for trace collection and [Trace Compass](http://tracecompass.org/) for visualization, some labs may use other tools.

Each lab has specific goals and objectives. The labs are composed of various tasks to achieve the goal and in the process. Each lab has a README, which contains suggestions for navigation of the tasks. 
There will also be sample traces and screenshots for each lab to help you guide through the UI and visualizations.

### Goals

  - Understand what tracing is and when it can be of help in diagnosing performance issues
  - Identify tracing tools and understand techniques that are used to generate traces
  - Selecting and using correct set of trace visualizations to quickly identify performance issues
  - Understand application/OS behavior and its internals using tracing

### Prerequisites

  - A Linux system or a Linux virtual machine
  - Basic understanding of Operating Systems fundamentals
  - Some experience in debugging applications and systems
